# ABRA
### University of Waterloo Game Jam Entry Fall 2019

A Bad Reliance Alliance (ABRA) is a game about a terrible symbiotic relationship between an innocent orange block trying to escape and an
uncooperative blue machine whoâ€™s coming along for the ride. You have full control of the orange block. Your goal is to push the blue
machine to the green exit in each level. The machine will receive upgrades between levels; however, you will not know what they are.
It will change the behaviour of the machine in undesirable ways, such as attempting to move further away from the exit and pushing
against you on its own accord. With a limited amount of space per level as well as dangerous hazards (such as lasers), will these
upgrades result in your demise or do they have a deeper purpose? Play ABRA to find out!
